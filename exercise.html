        <h2>Who Is Po</h2>
        <p> Master Ping Xiao Po[a] <span style="color: blue;">(born Li Lotus)</span> is the title character and protagonist of the Kung Fu Panda franchise,<br> primarily voiced by <span style="color: blue;">Jack Black</span>  and<span style="color: blue;">Mick Wingert</span> .<br>  He is an anthropomorphic giant panda who is improbably chosen as the champion of the Valley of Peace in the first film.</p>
        <p>Po is the prophesied Dragon Warrior or Dragon Master, as well as the Warrior of Black and White. <br>He is the adoptive son of Mr. Ping (a Chinese goose) and is one of Master Shifu's students. <br>Po is also the team leader of the Furious Five, although he is not properly part of it as he is considered <br>as a second master after Shifu to the Furious Five. <br>In Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, Po is revealed to have the ability to learn kung fu at a glance.</p>

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <P>Po's (played by Jack Black in the films) main interest lies in kung fu. He developed a comprehensive knowledge of the<BR> lore of warriors, famous combat moves, dates and historical artifacts. His deep appreciation of the martial arts extends<br> into its philosophical aspects, enabling him sometimes to achieve insights of which even deeply respected masters like <br>Shifu cannot conceive. He was popular with all his friends and they all loved him as a kid. He is an excellent cook but <br>has terrible table manners.

Though Po's real passion was for kung fu, he was reluctant to reveal this to his father in fear <br>of disappointing him. Despite having a mild and friendly personality, Po also developed a severe self-loathing, <br>believing himself a failure for his size and being a species not known for a warrior tradition.<br> When upset, he usually gorges on food. </P>
