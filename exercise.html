      <h2>Who Is Po</h2>
      <div class="div1">
        <p> Master Ping Xiao Po[a] <span style="color: blue;">(born Li Lotus)</span> is the title character and
          protagonist of the Kung Fu Panda franchise,<br> primarily voiced by <span style="color: blue;">Jack
            Black</span>
          and<span style="color: blue;"> Mick Wingert</span> .<br> He is an anthropomorphic giant panda who is improbably
          chosen as the champion of the Valley of Peace in the first film.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div1">
        <p>Po is the prophesied <span style="color: blue;">Dragon Warrior</span> or<span style="color: blue;"> Dragon
            Master</span> , as well as the<span style="color: blue;">Warrior of Black and White</span> . <br> He is the
          <i>adoptive son </i>of Mr. Ping <mark>(a Chinese goose)</mark> and is one of Master Shifu's students. <br> Po
          is
          also the team leader of the Furious Five, although he is not properly part of it as he is considered as a
          second master <br> after Shifu to the Furious Five. <br>In Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, Po is revealed to
          have the ability to learn kung fu at a glance.

      <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
      <P>Po's (played by Jack Black in the films) main interest lies in kung fu. He developed a comprehensive knowledge
        of the<BR> lore of warriors, famous combat moves, dates and historical artifacts. His deep appreciation of the
        martial arts extends<br> into its philosophical aspects, enabling him sometimes to achieve insights of which
        even deeply respected masters like <br>Shifu cannot conceive. He was popular with all his friends and they all
        loved him as a kid. He is an excellent cook but <br>has terrible table manners.

        Though Po's real passion was for kung fu, he was reluctant to reveal this to his father in fear <br>of
        disappointing him. Despite having a mild and friendly personality, Po also developed a severe self-loathing,
        <br>believing himself a failure for his size and being a species not known for a warrior tradition.<br> When
        upset, he usually gorges on food.
